# aggiestaar-2025
Welcome to the Github page for the [AggieSTAAR 2025](https://instrumentation.tamu.edu/aggiestaar/) Python Bootcamp! This page contains all of the notebooks that you will work through, as well as their accompanying slides. I ([Frank Wang](tx.ag/zfwang), [zfwang2@tamu.edu](zfwang2@tamu.edu)) have written all exercises and slides from scratch. This is my first time doing so, so please let me know if you have found a problem, or if you have any suggestions!

As mentioned, these slides and tutorials are to give summer undergraduate researchers in the 2025 AggieSTAAR program a quick introduction to Python. I have a time constraint of a single day, meaning that these tutorials are not as comprehensive as I would like them to be - they will only roughly cover the basics and some widely used modules/functions in astronomy. I have tried my best to write these tutorials for complete beginners, but complete beginners may find that the tutorials do move fast and skip over information. I recommend taking a look at resources like Code Academy or Imad Pasha and Chris Agostino's [Python for Astronomers](https://prappleizer.github.io/textbook.pdf) if you have never coded a line of Python before. 

For older, more experienced folks who have run a Python bootcamp before - I am very open to feedback, and certainly don't want to re-invent the wheel! Please let me know if there's something you feel like I should include, or if you have ideas on how I can improve.
