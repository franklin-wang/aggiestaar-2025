# aggiestaar-2025
Welcome to the Github page for the AggieSTAAR 2025 Python Bootcamp! This page contains all of the notebooks that you will work through, as well as their accompanying slides. 

Since the bootcamp is only a day long, this should not be considered as an extremely comprehensive introduction to Python. I will try my best to write these tutorials for complete beginners, but it will move quickly given the time constraints. I will try to cover what I consider to be absolutely vital astronomy Python skills, but I definitely may miss some things - your feedback is always appreciated! If you are completely new to Python, I do recommend taking a look at free resources online, like Code Academy. Imad Pasha and Chris Agostino's [Python for Astronomers](https://prappleizer.github.io/textbook.pdf) is also a helpful resource.
