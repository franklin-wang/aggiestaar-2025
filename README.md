# aggiestaar-2025
Welcome to the Github page for the [AggieSTAAR 2025](https://instrumentation.tamu.edu/aggiestaar/) Python Bootcamp! This page contains all of the notebooks that you will work through, as well as their accompanying slides. We ([Frank Wang](tx.ag/zfwang), [zfwang2@tamu.edu](zfwang2@tamu.edu) and Bri Wirag) have written all exercises and slides from scratch. Please let us know if you have found a problem, or if you have any suggestions!

As mentioned, these slides and tutorials are to give summer undergraduate researchers in the 2025 AggieSTAAR program a quick introduction to Python. We have a time constraint of a single day, meaning that these tutorials are not as comprehensive as we would like them to be - they will only roughly cover the basics and some widely used modules/functions in astronomy. We have tried our best to write these tutorials for complete beginners, but complete beginners may find that the tutorials do move fast and skip over information. We recommend taking a look at resources like Code Academy or Imad Pasha and Chris Agostino's [Python for Astronomers](https://prappleizer.github.io/textbook.pdf) if you have never coded a line of Python before. 

For older, more experienced folks who have run a Python bootcamp before - we are very open to feedback, and certainly don't want to re-invent the wheel! Please let us know if there's something you feel like we should include, or if you have ideas on how we can improve.
