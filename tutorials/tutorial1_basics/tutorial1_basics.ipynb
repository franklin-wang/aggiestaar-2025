    "\n",
    "In this section, we're going to go over some basics of Python. This is a slight step up from being COMPLETELY new to Python - I will assume you have a tiny bit of background knowledge. If you're completely new, I recommend going to a website like Khan Academy or Code Acaemy to get a grasp on your fundamentals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python codes are traditionally executed from \".py\" files: you write some code, put it in a .py file, run the .py file, and the file will do what you coded up. However, that's not the easiest way to use Python. Folks typically use Python notebooks like these (.ipynb files): these are easier to interact with and edit, but take a little more setting up.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're reading this, we've presumably set up Python on your computers, and have downloaded some sort of interface to use Python notebooks with. Most people use Jupyter (through Anaconda), I'm using a Microsoft software called VSCode. Use whatever you feel comfortable with, although I recommed Jupyter Notebooks since those are so widely used (and hopefully easier to troubleshoot). \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of executing .py files, we interact with blocks of code in Python notebooks. Let's execute your first line of code. You may get a message asking what Python environment you want to use - click the Python environment that you installed numpy, matplotlib, and astropy to. You can install these modules by typing \"pip install [module name]\" into a terminal, but I will have a separate tutorial for installing modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code blocks can be thought of as mini .py files - each code block can contain your code and can be executed. Code blocks can also remember the output from code blocks that were executed before it, but be VERY CAREFUL OF THE ORDER THEY ARE EXECUTED IN!\n",
    "\n",
